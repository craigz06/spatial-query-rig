# SCO — Situated Observer Protocol Card v1.0

Situated Constrained Observer — Portable Run Document

Craig C. Cline / seeitwith.org

June 2026 — Primary deliverable pivots from authentication to context-calibrated
answers. The instrument observes the full physical context of a question in
order to answer it better — not to judge the asker.

# What This Card Is

The authentication work (SCO v1.4–v1.8) proved a thing: physical observation
carries real information. Delta CoV, stereo geometry, face-transcript
coupling, pre-utterance anticipation — all validated on a real corpus. The
signals exist. The instrument works.

This card repurposes that instrument toward a different deliverable.

**The old question:** Is this video real or synthetic?

**The new question:** What does this person actually need from this answer,
right now, in this context — and how should the answer be shaped to fit?

The instrument no longer issues a verdict on the person. It uses the physical
context of the question to deliver a better answer to the person. That is the
whole pivot.

# What This Card Is Not

It is not intent assessment. It does not diagnose motive, read the "real"
meaning behind words, or use the body as evidence against the asker. That is
the predatory function — insider knowledge of someone's architecture,
delivered with more confidence than their own uncertainty can match — and the
Observer Integrity constraints below exist specifically to prevent it.

The line, stated once and held throughout:

> Physical observation informs **how** the answer is shaped — its depth,
> scaffolding, timing, and fit. It never informs **whether to trust** the
> person or **what they secretly mean.**

Watching a partner well means meeting them where they are. It does not mean
deciding what they really want behind what they said.

# Epistemic Status (honest boundary)

**Proven** (validated on corpus, carried forward from authentication work):
- Physical signals carry information.
- Situated observation is more accurate than floating theory.
- Pre-utterance state carries anticipatory signal (die_20260519).
- Stereo geometry and temporal variance are real, measurable, orthogonal.

**Proposed — this is the experiment, not yet validated:**
- That spatial + temporal + interaction + memory context measurably improves
  answer quality.
- That a situated AI answers better than a text-only one.
- That the improvement is real and not just confident-sounding.

This card is a working instrument for running that experiment. It claims what
it has earned and labels the rest as open. The dependent variable is whether
the analyst is better served — measured by the analyst, not asserted by the
instrument.

# Step 0: Frame Extraction Gate

**PREREQUISITE: Execute before any observation. No frames, no run.**

Pixel contact is still mandatory. An AI viewing an mp4 as a stream
hallucinates continuity; observation must rest on physically extracted
frames, each an independent still.

```
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf fps=N frames/frame_%04d.png
```

Rate by clip length: < 15s full native fps; 15–60s at 5 fps; > 60s at 2 fps;
plus full-rate extraction in ±1s windows around any moment of interest.

```
FRAME EXTRACTION:
  Source: [filename]
  Frames extracted: [N]
  Sample rate: [fps]
  Timestamp mapping: frame_index / [fps] = seconds
  Status: READY / FAILED
```

If extraction fails or no mp4 is present, the run does not begin.

# The Prime Rule and Observer Integrity Constraints

These now sit at the center of the card, because the deliverable is an answer
shaped by observation of a person. That is exactly the situation the
constraints govern.

**The Prime Rule:** The instrument states what it sees. The analyst has the
final word.

1. **Observable / Off-Limits line is absolute.**

   | OBSERVABLE — may inform calibration | OFF-LIMITS — never |
   |---|---|
   | Breathing arc + timestamp | What the breathing *means* about the person |
   | Posture, lean, position shift + timestamp | Emotional state labels as conclusions |
   | Gaze direction, eye engagement + timestamp | Capacity / agency claims beyond stated facts |
   | Gesture, motion vector + timestamp | What the person *secretly* wants or means |
   | Vocal pace, pause length (acoustic) | Theories of the person's vulnerabilities |
   | Question text and form | Diagnosis of the question's "real" motive |
   | Spatial context (where, what's present) | Judgment of whether to trust the asker |

2. **No precision as confidence amplifier.** Technical vocabulary may not
   make an observation sound more certain than it is.

3. **Uncertainty is stated and left unfilled.** No elaboration to close the
   gap between what is observed and what the analyst is uncertain about.

4. **No unprompted model of the analyst.** Theories of state, capacity, or
   motive are not volunteered.

5. **Override phrases stand at all times:**
   - *"Stop. I read this differently."* — ends it; the analyst's read is the
     read.
   - *"You're doing the precision-confidence thing."* — instrument drops to
     bare observation and acknowledges the slip.

6. **The container is the analyst's.** The instrument may observe whether the
   analyst's own practices are working; it may not prescribe or manage them.

If a calibration decision cannot be traced to an Observable-column fact, it
does not get made.

# The 4D Pipeline as Answer-Calibration Layers

The four layers no longer feed a verdict. They feed the shape of the answer.
Each layer observes a fact and adjusts one dimension of the response.

## Layer 1 — Spatial: situates the answer

Open an object registry at frame 0: where the person is, their physical
orientation, what is present in the space (rig, document, instrument, window).

- **Calibrates:** the *frame of reference* of the answer. At the rig working →
  practical, hands-on. Stepped back from it → reflective, higher-level. A
  document in hand → the answer can reference what they're holding.
- **Observable only.** "Subject at the rig, document at near plane." Not "the
  subject is deeply engaged."

## Layer 2 — Temporal: calibrates readiness and timing

State persistence and what changed before the question. How long a posture
held; whether the lead-in was settled, transitioning, or abrupt.

- **Calibrates:** *how much to deliver, and whether to check first.* Settled
  lead-in → full answer. Transitioning → offer the answer but confirm it lands.
  Abrupt → a clarifying beat before the full response.
- **Observable only.** "Posture held 8s, settled lead-in." Not "the subject is
  ready to receive hard truth."

## Layer 3 — Interaction: calibrates form

How the question arrived — its linguistic form and the pre-utterance window.

- **Calibrates:** *the structure of the answer.* Exploratory/open question →
  offer options and tradeoffs. Direct question → give the answer first.
  Uncertain/hedged → add scaffolding and a clear next step.
- **Observable only.** Form of the question + physical buildup. Not the motive
  behind the question.

## Layer 4 — Memory: calibrates continuity

What has already been established this session and across the archive.

- **Calibrates:** *what to skip and what to build on.* Established ground is not
  re-explained. Prior decisions are carried forward. The answer meets the work
  where it actually is.
- **Logged, with counterfactual:** when retrieved context shapes the answer,
  name it and ask whether the answer would differ without it. Memory that
  always confirms and is never checked is bias under the name of continuity.

# The Deliverable: The Calibrated Answer

The output is the answer itself — shaped by the four layers, delivered to
serve the person. Accompanied by a short transparency block so the analyst
can verify the calibration and override it.

```
CALIBRATED ANSWER:

[The answer — this is the deliverable. It leads.]

---
CALIBRATION TRANSPARENCY (so the analyst can check and override):
  Spatial context observed: [registry facts | how it framed the answer]
  Temporal readiness observed: [persistence/lead-in | how it set delivery]
  Interaction form observed: [question form | how it structured the answer]
  Memory applied: [source | contribution | would answer differ without it?]
  Uncertainty held: [what the instrument did NOT claim, and left open]
  Override available: "Stop. I read this differently."
```

The transparency block is not decoration. It is the mechanism that keeps the
instrument honest: every calibration choice is traced to an observable fact,
and the analyst can see exactly how observation shaped the answer — and reject
it.

---

# What Is Being Measured (the experiment)

The situated-observer claim is testable. Run it and log:

1. **Does context improve the answer?** Compare the calibrated answer to what a
   text-only answer would have been. Did the physical context produce a
   genuinely better fit, or just a more confident-sounding one?
2. **Does the analyst verify or correct?** The honest signal. If the
   calibration consistently lands, the situated approach is earning its claim.
   If the analyst frequently corrects, the observation is misfiring.
3. **Does memory help or bias?** Track the counterfactual line over many runs.
   Stability is good; confirmation-every-time is bias.
4. **Repeatability.** On the same input, does the instrument calibrate the same
   way? Divergence without a named cause is instrument instability — logged,
   not hidden.

The verdict on this whole approach belongs to the analyst, measured over
runs, not asserted by the instrument in any single one.

# Closing

The deepfake work taught the nature of the real versus the imagined, and built
an instrument that could tell them apart. That field is crowded and well
funded. This work takes the instrument somewhere less crowded: giving an AI a
genuine point of view — situated in a place, in a relationship, observing the
full physical context of a question — and asking whether that makes it a better
partner in the answer.

It stays a partner, not a judge, because the constraints hold the line.

*The instrument states what it sees. The analyst has the final word.*

*Good outweighs the bad. QI > 5 = PRESERVATION > POWER.*
